# Introduction 
The goal of this project was to showcase my ability to identify, formulate, and solve image processing problems while performing a real-time demonstration of an image processing example. From this project, I have developed a simple graphic user interface (GUI) that can load an image, apply an image processing technique, and display the input/output result. Specifically, I have designed a combination of image processing techniques to have my application take any image and output it as an oil style drawing. 

# Objective 
The objective of this project is to derive an “oil painting” like output given an input image. Specifically, the output image should have a unique texture that appears a bit rough and thick to mimic that of a dynamic and impressionistic effect. In my project, I tried to emphasize the effects by focusing on brush size strokes, intensity, and quantization level. 

# How it works
1. Save any photo(s) and esure the image file format is .PNG, .JEPG, or BMP
2. Press “Upload Image” button
3. A file directory will show up indicating which file you would like to upload, press "open" when you have found the image to upload
4. If the file you have uploaded is not the desired file, press “Clear Image” and repeat steps 2-3
5. Once the image is uploaded, use the scroll bars “Brush Size”, “Intensity”, and “Quant Levels” to manipulate the three categories
6. After deciding values from the scroll bars, click “Oil Painting” and watch the magic happen
7. If you decide to upload a new file, restart and complete step 2-6
